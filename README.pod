=head1 Current problems

=over

=item * Some OBO files aren't supported because not all edge cases are handled

=item * Uses a lot of memory (500MB to read and store GO)

=item * Currently ignores stanza tags that PomBase doesn't use (eg. "def:")

=item * The destination Chado database must contain:

- an is_a relation
- a CV named "synonym_type" containing all synonym type from input OBO files
