name: phenotype
def: "Any of the set of observable characteristics of an organism resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment." [PomBase:mah]
comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype.
